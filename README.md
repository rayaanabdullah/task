## A machine learning project to classify toxic content in online feedback using Random Forest, LSTM, and XLM-R. Focuses on multilingual support, class imbalance, and toxicity detection in diverse data.

# Project Overview

## Toxic Content Classification Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect and classify toxic content in online feedback. The primary goal is to predict whether a comment contains toxic content, using a variety of labels such as **abusive**, **vulgar**, **menace**, **offense**, and **bigotry**. The final prediction, however, focuses only on the **toxic** label, which indicates the presence of toxic language in a comment.

### Key Objectives:
- Classify feedback into different categories of toxicity.
- Predict whether a piece of feedback is toxic (binary classification).
- Address challenges such as language diversity and class imbalance in the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is divided into two main files:

1. **train.csv**: Contains labeled training data with the following columns:
   - **id**: Unique identifier for each comment.
   - **feedback_text**: The text of the feedback.
   - **toxic**: Binary label (1 for toxic, 0 for not toxic).
   - **abusive**: Binary label for abusive content.
   - **vulgar**: Binary label for vulgar language.
   - **menace**: Binary label for threatening language.
   - **offense**: Binary label for insults.
   - **bigotry**: Binary label for identity-based hate.

2. **test.csv**: Contains unlabeled data for evaluation during the testing phase.

### Language Distribution:
While the training data is in English, the testing and validation phases involve multiple languages. This introduces the need for handling multilingual content effectively.

### Class Imbalance:
There is a class imbalance in the dataset where toxic comments might not be evenly distributed across the different categories. The primary evaluation metric will focus on identifying whether the comment is **toxic** or not, though granular labels (such as abusive, vulgar, etc.) will also be useful during training.

## Model Implementation

### Steps to Build the Model:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize label distributions.
   - Analyze text features like sentence length, common words, etc.
   - Handle missing values or outliers.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenize the feedback text.
   - Convert text to lowercase and remove special characters.
   - Apply techniques like stemming or lemmatization.
   - Use feature extraction methods like TF-IDF or Transformer embeddings.

3. **Model Creation**:
   - **Random Forest**: A baseline model to capture basic patterns in the data.
   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A deep learning model for sequence data, capturing the sequential nature of text.
   - **XLM-R (Cross-lingual Model)**: A transformer-based model for multilingual text processing. Fine-tuning XLM-R allows the model to handle diverse languages effectively.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compute metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize performance with Confusion Matrices and AUC-ROC curves.

5. **Model Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters using methods like Grid Search or Random Search.

### Deliverables:
- Two Jupyter notebooks or Python files implementing the models.
- Performance analysis reports, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- Full explanation of the choices made in terms of model architecture and evaluation.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebooks or Python files for both models:
   - `model1_implementation.ipynb` (Random Forest and LSTM models).
   - `model2_implementation.ipynb` (XLM-R model).

4. Evaluate the models using the test dataset and review the performance metrics.

## Model Evaluation Results

- The model's performance will be evaluated based on several key metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy**: Overall prediction accuracy.
  - **Precision**: Precision of predicting toxic comments.
  - **Recall**: Sensitivity of the model in detecting toxic content.
  - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - **AUC-ROC**: Area under the ROC curve to assess classification performance.

## Additional Notes:
- This project is designed to simulate real-world content moderation challenges.
- Handling multilingual content and class imbalance are key aspects of the solution.
